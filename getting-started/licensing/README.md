# Licensing

_There are two licensing schemes for TeraChem - node-locked and IP-checkout. Older versions of TeraChem (v1.5K and earlier) used the node-locked scheme exclusively. TeraChem will run in demo mode if an appropriate license is not found. In demo mode, the program will run for a maximum of 15 minutes and will use at most two GPU cards in parallel. If license files for both schemes are present in the TeraChem directory, TeraChem will use the node-locked licensing scheme corresponding to the license.dat file._
