# Node-Locked Licenses

The node-locked license scheme is based on a file license.dat which should be in the directory given in the TeraChem environment variable. This file is obtained by sending the MAC addresses of the machines which are to be licensed to help@petachem.com. PetaChem will create an appropriate license file and send this back to you. Save the file as **license.dat** in the TeraChem directory and all restrictions should be removed.

License files are typically created with a time limit of two years. This enables us to replace the license file if needed (for example if a machine is upgraded). If the license file expires, please send the old license file to help@petachem.com along with purchaser information and we will provide you with an updated license file.

For reference, here is an example **license.dat** file (this file is not valid â€“ it is for demonstration purposes only):
